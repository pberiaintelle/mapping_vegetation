PlanetScope NICFI monthly mosaics were used to calculate parameters including the median, standard deviation and the first and last percentile values per pixel.
CIG vegetation index was also calculated. All the parameters were calculated separately for both seasons. Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) provides 30-meter resolution elevation data with global coverage.
Due to the terrain features of the area elevation data and derivatives (slope and aspect) were included in the inputs for the classification.
